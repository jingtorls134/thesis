Determining the stability of chemical compounds is essential for advancing material discovery. 
In this study, we introduce a novel deep neural network model designed to predict a crystal's formation energy. 
Our model leverages elemental fractions derived from material composition and incorporates the space group as an additional input feature. 
The materials' space group classifications represent the crystal polymorphs and are crucial for understanding phase transitions in materials. 
Our findings demonstrate that the integration of space group information significantly enhances the predictive performance of the developed deep learning architecture. 
In addition, we use the same model architecture to predict the energy above hull, an indicator to material stability, with formation energy as an additional input feature.
